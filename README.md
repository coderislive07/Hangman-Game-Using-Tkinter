<h1>Hangman Game</h1>
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. Hangman is a word guessing game where the player must guess letters in order to uncover a hidden word, with each incorrect guess resulting in a piece of a stick figure being drawn. The goal is to guess the word before the stick figure is completed.

Features:
Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of food items.
Graphical representation of the hangman's gallows as incorrect guesses are made.
User-friendly interface built using Tkinter.
Feedback messages for correct and incorrect guesses.
Option to start a new game after completing or failing the current one.
Usage:
Run the Python script hangman.py.
Guess letters by clicking on the on-screen keyboard or typing them in the console.
Try to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn!
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Tkinter (included in standard Python library)
